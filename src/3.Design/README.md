# Design üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Design** section of the Azure Integration Services (AIS) Project Governance Toolkit. This section contains resources and templates to help you effectively create high-level and low-level designs for your AIS projects.

## Contents

- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Guidelines and templates for creating an overview of the system architecture and design.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Detailed design documents and templates for implementing the system components.
- **Reusable Components**: Standardized patterns, templates, and configurations for AIS solutions that can be leveraged in future engagements or within the same project.
- **Risk and Issues Register**: Tools to identify, document, and manage risks and issues from the design stage.

## Resources

### High-Level Design (HLD)
Use these guidelines and templates to create a high-level overview of the system architecture. This will help in visualizing the overall structure and components of the AIS project.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)
Develop detailed design documents using these templates. This will assist in defining the specific components, configurations, and workflows required for the implementation phase.

[Low-Level Design Template](Templates/LowLevel_Design_Template.md)

### Reusable Components
Capture and organize reusable architectural patterns, integration templates, and tested configurations here. These assets will streamline future AIS implementations by reducing development effort and ensuring consistency.

### Risk and Issues Register
Identify and document potential risks and issues early in the design phase using these tools. This will help in proactively managing and mitigating any challenges that may arise.
