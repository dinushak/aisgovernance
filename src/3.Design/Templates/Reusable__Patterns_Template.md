# AIS Reusable Design Patterns Template üõ†Ô∏è

## Overview
This document consolidates **reusable design patterns** for Azure Integration Services (AIS). These patterns provide standardized frameworks for designing scalable, reliable, and efficient AIS solutions.

## Why Use Reusable Patterns?
- **Standardization**: Ensures architectural consistency across AIS projects.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces design effort by reusing proven approaches.
- **Scalability**: Enables modular and extensible designs.
- **Governance**: Improves compliance with best practices.

## **Reusable Design Patterns üìå**

### **1. API Gateway Design Pattern**
**Purpose**:  
Provides a centralized entry point for managing AIS APIs, enforcing security, and handling request transformations.

**Key Components**:
- Authentication & Authorization (OAuth2, API Keys)
- Rate Limiting & Traffic Control
- Request/Response Transformation
- Logging & Monitoring

**Placeholder for Design Diagram**:  
_(Insert architecture diagram illustrating the API Gateway flow)_

**Considerations**:
- Useful for multi-service integrations.
- Ensures secure API access control.

### **2. Event-Driven Messaging Pattern**
**Purpose**:  
Enables asynchronous communication between AIS components using event-driven workflows.

**Key Components**:
- Azure Event Grid for event propagation.
- Azure Service Bus for message queuing.
- Publish-Subscribe model for distributed event handling.

**Placeholder for Design Diagram**:  
_(Insert workflow diagram showing event-driven architecture)_

**Considerations**:
- Reduces dependency between services.
- Supports scalability in microservices architectures.

### **3. Error Handling & Resilience Pattern**
**Purpose**:  
Standardizes error detection, logging, and automated retry mechanisms for AIS solutions.

**Key Components**:
- Centralized logging using Azure Monitor.
- Exponential retry logic for transient failures.
- Alerting for critical system errors.

**Considerations**:
- Prevents data loss in failure scenarios.
- Improves fault tolerance for AIS services.

### **4. Security & Compliance Design Pattern**
**Purpose**:  
Ensures AIS solutions adhere to security best practices and compliance regulations.

**Key Components**:
- Token-based authentication (OAuth2, Managed Identity).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources.
- Data encryption for sensitive payloads.

**Placeholder for Design Diagram**:  
_(Insert security architecture diagram)_

**Considerations**:
- Enhances API security posture.
- Ensures compliance with industry standards.


### **5. Standardized Integration Flow Pattern**
**Purpose**:  
Provides a structured approach for AIS-based data transformations and integrations.

**Key Components**:
- Request-Response Model for synchronous interactions.
- Batch Processing for large-scale data movement.
- Pipeline Orchestration using Logic Apps.

**Placeholder for Design Diagram**:  
_(Insert integration workflow diagram)_

**Considerations**:
- Improves consistency in AIS solutions.
- Optimizes data processing workflows.

### **6. Email Sending via Microsoft Graph API**
**Purpose**:  
Provides a standardized approach for sending emails programmatically within AIS solutions using **Microsoft Graph API**.

**Key Components**:
- **Graph API Endpoint** for sending email (`/me/sendMail` or `/users/{id}/sendMail`)
- **OAuth2 authentication** using Azure AD App Registration
- **Dynamic Email Templates** for structured and formatted messages

**Placeholder for Design Diagram**:  
_(Insert workflow illustrating how Graph API interacts with AIS components)_

**Considerations**:
- Requires proper **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) permissions**.
- Ideal for **event-driven notifications** such as approvals or system alerts.
- Supports sending emails on behalf of specific users or service accounts.
