## 7. High level Non-Functional Considerations
Discuss the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the system, including:

### Performance
Outline the performance requirements, such as response times, throughput, and latency.

### Scalability
Describe how the system will handle increased load and the ability to scale up or down as needed.

### Security
Discuss the security measures and considerations for the system, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and compliance requirements.

### Availability
Specify the availability requirements, including uptime, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans.

### Maintainability
Detail the maintainability requirements, including ease of updates, debugging, and system monitoring.

### Usability
Describe the usability requirements, focusing on user experience, accessibility, and interface design.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumptions made during the design process and any dependencies that the project relies on.

## 9. Conclusion
Summarize the key points of the high-level design and outline the next steps for the project.
