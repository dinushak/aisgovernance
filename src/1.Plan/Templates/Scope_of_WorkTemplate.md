# Scope of Work (SOW)

## Project Title
Azure Integration Services (AIS) Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement Azure Integration Services (AIS) to streamline and enhance the integration of various business applications and services within the organization. The project will leverage AIS components such as Logic Apps, Service Bus, Event Grid, and API Management to achieve seamless data flow and process automation.

## Objectives
- Integrate various business applications to ensure seamless data exchange and process automation.
- Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual intervention through automated workflows.
- Implement scalable integration solutions that can grow with the organization's needs.
- Maintain high security standards for data exchange and integration processes.

## Scope of Work
### In Scope
1. **Planning & Discovery**
   - Conduct project planning and resource allocation.
   - Organize discovery workshops to gather requirements from stakeholders.
   - Develop a detailed project plan and timeline.

2. **Design**
   - Develop high-level and low-level architecture designs for the AIS solution.
   - Create design documentation and conduct design walk-through workshops.
   - Perform proof of concept (POC) if required to validate the design.

3. **Implementation**
   - Ensure integration environment readiness, including source and target environments.
   - Configure landing zones for the Azure environment.
   - Establish DevOps projects, configurations, and repositories for the assignment.
   - Configure specific AIS components such as Logic Apps, Service Bus, Event Grid, Function Apps, Azure Data Factory, and Storage Accounts.
   - Develop Azure Functions and Logic Apps.
   - Implement disaster recovery and high availability components.
   - Perform data migration if required.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for Azure Functions and Logic Apps.
   - Conduct integration testing.
   - Perform vulnerability assessment and penetration testing using Azure Security Center and other tools.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT).

5. **Deployment**
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines.
   - Deploy solutions to non-production environments.
   - Deploy solutions to production environments.
   - Perform post-deployment verification.

6. **Closure**
   - Establish monitoring and logging using Azure Monitor.
   - Resolve any outstanding issues.
   - Prepare and deliver project closure documentation.

### Out of Scope
- Development of new business applications.
- Major upgrades to existing infrastructure outside of AIS components.
- Long-term maintenance and support beyond the initial implementation phase.

## Deliverables
- Detailed project plan and timeline.
- High-level and low-level architecture designs.
- Design documentation and POC results.
- Configured AIS components and developed integration workflows.
- Test plans and test results.
- Deployment scripts and CI/CD pipeline configurations.
- Monitoring and logging setup.
- Project closure documentation.
