# AIS Maintenance Plan

## 1. Regular System Checks
### 1.1 Daily
- Monitor the health and performance of AIS components using Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
- Check for any critical alerts or notifications related to Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, and Event Grid, and address them promptly.

### 1.2 Weekly
- Review system logs and diagnostics for AIS components to identify any unusual activity or errors.
- Verify the status of all AIS components, including Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, and Event Grid, ensuring they are running optimally.

### 1.3 Monthly
- Conduct a thorough review of performance metrics for AIS components and identify any trends or potential issues.
- Perform routine maintenance tasks such as clearing temporary files, optimizing databases, and ensuring connectors and integrations are functioning correctly.

## 2. Security Updates
### 2.1 Patch Management
- Apply security patches and updates to all AIS components, including Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, and Event Grid, as soon as they are released.
- Test patches in a staging environment before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and stability.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Scanning
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans on AIS components to identify and address any security weaknesses.
- Implement recommended security measures to protect against potential threats, such as configuring firewalls and access controls.

## 3. Backup and Recovery
### 3.1 Backup Strategy
- Schedule regular backups of all critical data and configurations for AIS components.
- Ensure all components are included in infrastructure as code (IaC) and can be replicated by deploying through pipelines.
- Ensure all development components (e.g., Azure Functions, Logic Apps) are included in repositories.
- Ensure storage is properly backed up

### 3.2 Recovery Testing
- Perform periodic recovery tests to ensure that backups of AIS components can be restored successfully.
- Document recovery procedures for Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, and Event Grid, and ensure all team members are familiar with them.

## 4. Performance Optimization
### 4.1 Resource Management
- Monitor resource usage for AIS components and optimize the allocation of resources to ensure efficient operation.
- Scale resources up or down based on current and projected workloads for Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, and Event Grid.

### 4.2 Performance Tuning
