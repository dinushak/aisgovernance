# AIS Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Azure Integration Services (AIS) solution, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). The goal is to ensure that all components of the AIS solution function correctly and meet the specified requirements.

## 2. Objectives
- Verify that individual components of the AIS solution function as expected (Unit Testing).
- Ensure that integrated components work together seamlessly (Integration Testing).
- Validate that the AIS solution meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment (User Acceptance Testing).

## 3. Scope
The scope of this test plan includes testing the following AIS components:
- Logic Apps
- Service Bus
- API Management
- Event Grid
- Azure Functions

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Testing
**Objective**: Verify that individual components of the AIS solution function as expected.

**Scope**:
- Test individual Logic Apps workflows.
- Test Azure Functions for correct execution and output.
- Validate Service Bus message handling.

**Tools**:
- Visual Studio/Azure DevOps for writing and executing unit tests.
- Postman for testing API endpoints.

**Test Cases**:
- Logic Apps: Verify that each workflow executes correctly with expected inputs and outputs.
- Azure Functions: Test each function with various input scenarios to ensure correct processing.
- Service Bus: Validate message sending, receiving, and processing.

### 4.2 Integration Testing
**Objective**: Ensure that integrated components work together seamlessly.

**Scope**:
- Test interactions between Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, Event Grid, and Azure Functions.
- Validate end-to-end workflows and data flow between components.

**Tools**:
- Azure DevOps for managing and executing integration tests.
- Postman for testing API integrations.

**Test Cases**:
- End-to-End Workflow: Validate that data flows correctly through the entire AIS solution, from input to output.
- API Integration: Test API endpoints managed by API Management to ensure they interact correctly with backend services.
- Event Handling: Verify that events are correctly published and consumed by Event Grid and related components.

### 4.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
**Objective**: Validate that the AIS solution meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.

**Scope**:
- Conduct UAT with business users to ensure the solution meets their needs.
- Validate that all functional and non-functional requirements are met.

**Tools**:
- Azure DevOps for managing UAT test cases and tracking issues.
- Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration with business users.

**Test Cases**:
- Business Scenarios: Validate that the AIS solution supports all required business scenarios.
- User Interface: Ensure that any user interfaces (e.g., dashboards) are user-friendly and meet user expectations.
- Performance: Validate that the solution performs well under expected load conditions.
