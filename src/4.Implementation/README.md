### Risk and Issues Register
Identify and document potential risks and issues during the implementation phase using these tools. This will help in proactively managing and mitigating any challenges that may arise.

[Risk and Issues Register Template](../3.Design/Templates/Risks_Issues_Template.md)

### Project Cadence
Regular meetings and communication channels to ensure project progress and address issues:

- **Daily Standup**: A brief daily meeting with the project team, including the client, to discuss progress, blockers, and plans for the day. During this meeting in-progress tickets will be discussed.
- **Weekly Progress Meeting**: A weekly meeting with stakeholders, including vendors and related parties, to review project progress, milestones, and deliverables.
- **Weekly Issues & Risks Meeting**: A weekly meeting with the project team, including the client, to discuss any issues and risks, and develop mitigation strategies.
- **Shared MS Teams Channel**: A dedicated Microsoft Teams channel to facilitate ongoing communication and collaboration with stakeholders.
