# Azure Integration Services (AIS) Project Governance Toolkit üöÄ
Welcome to the Azure Integration Services (AIS) Project Governance Toolkit repository! This toolkit is designed to provide essential resources and guidance for successfully managing and governing AIS projects.

Governing the implementation of an Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution, such as Azure Integration Services, is distinct from other integration assignments. The nature of iPaaS projects often involves:

- **Accelerated Timelines**: A compressed timeframe to discover, design, and implement the solution, requiring efficient planning and execution.
- **Inherent Complexities**: Challenges unique to cloud implementations, including scalability, security, and compliance considerations.
- **Component Interactions**: AIS implementation is complicated as it requires many components, such as Logic Apps, Service Bus, API Management, Event Grid, and Azure Functions, to interact seamlessly to deliver a cohesive solution.

 The repository is organized into several key phases of a project lifecycle, each containing relevant content to support your AIS assignments.
